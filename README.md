## What is Bitchcoin?
Bitchcoin is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although with many key differences. Bitchcoin's wallet is forked from Bitcoin 0.9.2, and thus has a build process slightly different from most altcoins.

## Features

The key features of Bitchcoin:

* X11 Proof of work (low power, cool hardware, ASIC resistant, etc)
* One minute block times
* Digishield is used initially for difficulty adjustment. After block 40352, Slingshield is used for difficulty adjustment


## License
Bitchcoin is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING)

## Development and contributions
